I am a Research Associate at Imperial College London and previously completed a PhD degree under the supervision of Prof. Nobuko Yoshida. My research interests are in the area of distributed systems and networks, as well as type systems and language design. My PhD focuses on development and applications of a type theory (called session types) for runtime verification of concurrent and distributed systems.
